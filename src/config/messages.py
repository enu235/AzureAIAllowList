üîí PRIVATE REPOSITORY HANDLING:

Private repositories detected cannot be directly added to Azure ML outbound rules.
Consider these alternatives:

1. AZURE STORAGE APPROACH:
   ‚Ä¢ Upload private packages to Azure Blob Storage
   ‚Ä¢ Configure your workspace storage account for package access
   ‚Ä¢ Use pip install from blob storage URLs
   
   Example:
   pip install https://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/packages/yourpackage.whl

2. AZURE CONTAINER REGISTRY:
   ‚Ä¢ Build custom Docker images with pre-installed packages
   ‚Ä¢ Push to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
   ‚Ä¢ Reference in your ML environments
   
3. AZURE ARTIFACTS:
   ‚Ä¢ Use Azure DevOps Artifacts as a private Python feed
   ‚Ä¢ Configure authentication and access policies
   ‚Ä¢ Add artifacts.dev.azure.com to allowed domains

4. PRIVATE ENDPOINTS:
   ‚Ä¢ If your private repo supports it, create private endpoints
   ‚Ä¢ Add private endpoint outbound rules to workspace

For detailed guidance, see: docs/private-repositories.md

üñ•Ô∏è PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS:

WINDOWS vs LINUX PACKAGES:
‚Ä¢ Some packages have different dependencies on Windows vs Linux
‚Ä¢ Binary packages (wheels) are often platform-specific
‚Ä¢ Consider your Azure ML compute target platform when reviewing domains

RECOMMENDATIONS:
‚Ä¢ If using Linux compute: Focus on Linux-compatible packages
‚Ä¢ If using Windows compute: Ensure Windows wheel availability
‚Ä¢ Cross-platform packages: Usually work on both platforms
‚Ä¢ Source distributions: May require compilation tools

COMMON PLATFORM-SPECIFIC DOMAINS:
‚Ä¢ *.pythonhosted.org - Universal (both platforms)
‚Ä¢ *.anaconda.org - Cross-platform conda packages
‚Ä¢ Some packages may use different mirrors for different platforms

üîó TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES:

This tool discovers both direct and transitive (indirect) dependencies.
Transitive dependencies are packages required by your direct dependencies.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
‚Ä¢ Your requirements.txt may list 10 packages
‚Ä¢ But those packages might depend on 50+ additional packages
‚Ä¢ Each dependency may come from different domains
‚Ä¢ All domains need to be allowed for successful package installation

EXAMPLE:
requests ‚Üí urllib3, certifi, charset-normalizer, idna
pandas ‚Üí numpy, python-dateutil, pytz

The tool captures all these dependency relationships automatically.

‚ùå AZURE CLI SETUP REQUIRED:

Before using this tool, ensure Azure CLI is properly configured:

1. INSTALL AZURE CLI:
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
   
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows -OutFile .\\AzureCLI.msi; Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList '/I AzureCLI.msi /quiet'
   
   # macOS
   brew install azure-cli

2. INSTALL ML EXTENSION:
   az extension add --name ml

3. LOGIN TO AZURE:
   az login
   
4. SET SUBSCRIPTION (if you have multiple):
   az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"

5. VERIFY ACCESS:
   az ml workspace list --resource-group "your-resource-group"

üîç DRY RUN MODE:

Running in dry-run mode - no Azure API calls will be made.
This mode is useful for:
‚Ä¢ Testing package discovery without Azure authentication
‚Ä¢ Understanding what domains would be discovered
‚Ä¢ Validating input files before running full analysis

Note: Workspace analysis is skipped in dry-run mode.
